# Java Programs

Here you will find the **Documentations** of the code with _proper_ explanations. The **Doumentation** is ~~length~~ so that the readers will have an ease of _understanding each concept_.

With referance to the Documentation of the previous programs, the Documentation gets shorter and only the new concepts are explained.

This Documentation will have the following features for ease of use and readability

- You will have codeblocks like these
```Java
System.out.printf("Codeblock");
```

- Any special code will be `highlighted`

- There will be
> **Warnings**

> A Warning on what to be careful about
> 

{style="warning"}

> 

{style="tip"}
